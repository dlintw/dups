dups.go
=======

A small command line utility to find duplicate files written in the
[go](http://golang.org) language.

The current version is rather slow, as it hashes every single file it
encounters. I will implement the suggestions mentioned in the
[golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/golang-nuts/b6IIDDaWLok)
mailing list thread to make it faster.
